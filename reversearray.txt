The first loop is :
for (i=0;i<m;i++)
    n[i]=sc.nextInt();
This loop is used to take user inputs in the array.
Its time complexity is O(n)

The secound loop is :
for(i=0;i<m;i++)
    System.out.print("\t"+n[i]);
This loop is used for outputing the original array before any changes.
Its time complexity is O(n)

The third loop is : 
for (i=0;i<m/2;i++)
{
    t=n[i];
    n[i]=n[m-1-i];
    n[m-1-i]=t;
}
This loop is used for reversing the original array. Here we can see the loop is iterating at m/2 times.
Its time complexity is O(n/2)

The final loop is :
for(i=0;i<m;i++)
    System.out.print("\t"+n[i]);
This loop is used to show the new reaaranged array.
Its time complexity is O(n)

So total time complexity in the loop is 
-> O(n)+O(n)+O(n/2)+O(n)
->O(3n/2)
